The following will be submitted:
 1. A tidy dataset fits the criterion of a tidy dataset as outlined in the course
 2. A link to a Github repository where the analysis script is located
 3. A CodeBook.MD file that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
 4. A README.md in the repo with the analysis script.
